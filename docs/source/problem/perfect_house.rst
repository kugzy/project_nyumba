The Perfect House
++++++++++++++++++


In this context, the perfect house refers to a humble abode with the best energy efficiency (Looses the least amount of energy to the outside world).
We are going to use the following three tupe of houses as a bench mark:
#. Passive house.
#. Enerphit retofitted house.
#. A new build built to modern UK housing regulations.


Passive House
-------------

This is the gold standard when it comes to the energy efficiency of a home. 
A passive house represents the gold standard approach to building design with a huge emphasis on energy efficiency, sustainability and occupant comfort. It achives this by following the following principles:

#. Super thermal insulation:

    * The opaque components of the house (Walls, roofs, and floors) need to have a very high levels of insulation to minimize heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer. The need to achieve at least a U-Value of 0.15 W/m²·K so that the house does not need more than 15kwh/m2.

#. Airtight Construction:

    * The building envelope (the outer shell of the house) needs to be extremely airtight, reducing drafts and energy loss. 

    * The goal of the air tighness need to achieve a blower test result of less than 0.6 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals of pressure (ACH50).

#. High-Performance Windows and Doors.

    * The windows need to achieve a U-Value of atleats 0.8 W/m²·K . To achive this windows need to be triple-glazed and have low-emissivity (low-e) coatings to reduce heat transfer.

    * Window frames should be well-insulated, and doors are designed to be airtight to support the first two principles we mentioned.

#. Ventilation with Heat Recovery:

    * By making a the building envelope you need a ventilation system  with atleast 75% heat revover, this mean traditional ventilation systems such as trickle vents and opening windows and we need to be thinking of soe sort of mechanical ventilation system.

#. Thermal Bridge-Free Design:

    * The building envelope is deigned to eliminate where heat can bypass the insulation.

Achieving the listed principles should give us the following benefits:

* *Energy Efficiency* : Passive houses use up to 90% less energy for heating and cooling compared to conventional buildings.
* *Comfort* : Consistent indoor temperatures, high indoor air quality, and no drafts contribute to a comfortable living environment.
* *Environmental Impact* : Reduced energy consumption leads to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint.
* *Cost Savings* : Significantly lower energy bills result in long-term savings.
* *Resilience* : High levels of insulation and airtightness make passive houses more resilient to extreme weather conditions and power outages.

Enerphit Retofit
-----------------

An EnerPHit retrofit refers to a renovating an existing buildings to achieve high energy efficiency and comfort levels similar to those of new Passive House buildings but also recognizes the challenges and limitations of retrofitting older buildings, such as historical preservation constraints, existing structural issues, and budget considerations. With this recognition it still follows the same key principles of a passive house but with slightly more forgiving parametres.

#. Thermal insulation:

    * Enerphit nequires the opaque components of the house at least a U-Value of 0.3 W/m²·K (internal insulation)

#. Airtight Construction:

    * The building envelope still needs to be airtight but the goal of the air tighness is only required to be only below 1.0 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals of pressure (ACH50).

    * The goal of the air tighness need to achieve a blower test result of less than 0.6 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals of pressure (ACH50).

#. Windows  are still expected to be around the U-value of 0.8 W/m²·K (triple glazed still)

#. Mechanicl ventilation is still highly prefered

#. Thermal Bridge should be minimised as much as possible in a resonable sense.


Modern Day Newbuilds
---------------------

In the UK, the building standards for new constructions requires the building to meet the following requirements:

#. U-Values:

    * The maximum U-value allowed is 0.30 W/m²·K.
    * For windows, the maximum U-value allowed is 1.6 W/m²·K.
    * For roofs, the maximum U-value allowed is 0.2 W/m²·K.
    * For windows, the maximum U-value allowed is 0.25 W/m²·K.

#. Air Tightness:

    * The desired air tighness needs to be less than 5 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals of pressure (ACH50).

Over  the next 12 months , the goal is to see how close our retrofit ends up to one of the three standards we discussed today, while manoeuvring the constraints of building physics, budget and time. Its going to be a wild and bumpy ride but hopefully very rewarding one, so plese buckle up.
